# List_Generator
This project enables generation of lists of numbers based on sequences. Lists of the following 5 sequences can be generated: Catalan, Fibonacci, Palindrome, Perfect Square and Prime.
Whereas these lists can be filtered by digit count and/or minimum and maximum values. </br> </br>
In addition, single numbers can be researched to check to which sequences they do and do not belong to. </br>
